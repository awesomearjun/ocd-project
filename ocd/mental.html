    <p>Mental illnesses are health conditions, but they involve emotions, thinking, and/or behaviours. They are linked with distress,<br>problems in social environments. Half of all mental illnesses begin by 14, but OCD can begin at any age; OCD usually starts at 14 too though.<br><br>Just like most mental illnesses, 50-60% of people report getting OCD post-traumatic events, such as:<br>
    » Illness or hospitalization<br>
    » Illness or hospitalization for a family member<br>
    » Death of a loved one<br>
    » Changes at home and/or family<br>
    » Challenges with home or school<br>
    » Change/loss of job<br>
    » Losing something that you value<br>
    » New relationship<br>
    » Marriage<br>
    » Pregnancy or giving birth<br>
    » A breakup or divorce<br>
    » Neglect, abust, or assault<br><br>
    This list is quasi-definitive, as scientists don't actually have a certain cause of OCD.
