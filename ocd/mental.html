    <p>Mental illnesses are health conditions, but they involve <a href="./emotions.html" id="special">emotions</a>, thinking, and/or behaviours. They are linked with distress,<br>and problems in social environments. Half of all mental illnesses begin by 14, but OCD can begin at any age; OCD usually starts at 14 too though.<br><br>Just like most mental illnesses, 50-60% of people report getting OCD post-traumatic events, such as:<br>
    » Illness or hospitalization<br>
    » Illness or hospitalization for a family member<br>
    » Death of a loved one<br>
    » Changes at home and/or family<br>
    » Challenges with home or school<br>
    » Change/loss of job<br>
    » Losing something that they value<br>
    » New relationship<br>
    » Marriage<br>
    » Pregnancy or giving birth<br>
    » A breakup or divorce<br>
    » Neglect, abuse, or assault<br><br>
    This list is quasidefinitive though, as scientists don't actually have a certain cause of OCD.<br>
    What we do know, however, is how to help someone with ocd. Someone with OCD can:<br>
    » Go to OCD clinics<br>
    » Join a support group<br>
    » Get help from local affiliates<br>
    » Get help from a global partner<br>
    » If it gets to the suicide point, dial 988<br>
