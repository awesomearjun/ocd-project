  <p id="content">OCD is a mental disorder that stands for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. People with OCD have time consuming compulsions, and/or obsessions.<br>
    An obsession is a recurring thought, urge, or mental image. They can be intrusive, unwanted, and make them feel anxious. <br>
    Compulsions are recurring behaviours, most of the times in response to an obsession. <br>
    It's a long lasting disorder, but there is treatment for it.</p>
