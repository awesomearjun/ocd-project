  <p id="content">OCD is a mental disorder that stands for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. People with OCD have time consuming compulsions, and/or obsessions.<br>
    An obsession is a recurring thought, urge, or mental image. They can be intrusive, unwanted, and make them feel anxious; such as:<br>
    » Fear of things being dirty<br>
    » Fear of losing something<br>
    » Fear of going out of control with their behaviour<br>
    » Agressive thoughts against themselves<br>
    » Obsessively thinking that things have to be perfect<br><br>

    Compulsions are recurring behaviours, most of the times in response to an obsession, such as:<br>
    » Overly cleaning or handwashing<br>
    » Arranging items in a specific way<br>
    » Repeatitively checking on things, like if a door is locked, or an appliance is on<br><br>

    Not all repeated thoghts are obsessions, and not all repeated actions are compulsions. However, people with OCD generally: <br>
    » Can’t control their obsessions or compulsions<br>
    » Spend around/over 1 hour every day on their habits<br>
    » Don’t feel pleasure from completing their obsessions or compulsions but get temporary relief from their anxiety<br>
    » Experience big problems due to these habits<br><br>

    Some people with OCD also have Tourette's, which is kind of like a compulsion. OCD is a long lasting disorder, but there is treatment.<br><br>
