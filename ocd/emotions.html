    <p>YOU MADE IT TO THE END! YIPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>
        Emotions... Speaking of emotions: INSIDE OUT 2<br>
        Good move, right? Well what emotions would OCD connect to? These are my<br>
        personal picks according the Inside Out Fandom's definitions.<br><br>

        1. Fear<br>
        Most of the obsessions and compulsions a person could have are based<br>on fears for something, whether its:<br>
        * Fear of germs<br>
        * Fear of losing something<br>
        * Obsessively washing hands<br><br>

        2. Anxiety<br>
        She gives feeling of tension, restlessness, worriness, and/or guilt<br>
        These are the feelings that people have that trigger their compulsions or obsessions<br><br>

        3. A little disgust<br>
        For fear of germs, you can see that they can be triggered by their disgust<br><br><br><br>
